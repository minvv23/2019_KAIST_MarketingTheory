Since it provides affluent opportunities to handle the key concepts of social science including emotion, user interaction, and opinion formation, *online trolling and swearing effects* has been a main concern in computational social science and its adjacent fields.

    "The *Attribution Theory* takes an important role as a theoretical base on the relations between online trolling and human feature salience. Above all, it is a clear idea that the different attribution leads to different attitude on judgement (Cullen et al, 1985). Social psychologists add that angry agents are prone to express their emotion more intensely when the source of the anger is provided, since it enables the attribution to that source.  Furthermore, according to *Affect-as-information* approach, the cognitive output from an affect is mediated by subjective experience. (Clore et al, 2001) On mood effects on judgement, for instance, attention to feeling functions as a mediator. (Gasper & Clore, 1999) Such source salient circumstance is highly similar with online news platform environment. When positing the news commenters with an explicit political predisposition, they would be more likely to show harsher attitude to the article when the human feature is provided as a specific emotion provoking source in the image."

If we use swear words dictionary, it would be hardly possible to detect the correlation between these variations. Such predicament would still not be alleviated when using POS(Part of Speech) tagged words, since there are almost infinite possibility to generate new variation simply by adding or substituting a single subcharacter. However, if we split subcharacters of words and then apply FasatText, the shared subcharacters and subsequent n-grams shared among these words such as *{ㅂ, ㅇ, ㅅ, ㅣ, ㄴ}*, *{ㅣㅇ, ㅇㅅ, ㅣㄴ}*, and *{ㅣㅇㅅ}* are now detected.
